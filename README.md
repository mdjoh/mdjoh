## Projects

[Medical Diagnosis using Generative AI](https://github.com/mdjoh/HealthBot-GenAI)

This is a proof-of-concept application leveraging a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate medical diagnoses based on symptons entered by a user.

[Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis](https://github.com/mdjoh/diabetes-classification)

This project used machine learning and neural network algorithms to classify whether a person has diabetes. Using a neural network produced the best prediction score (macro F1 score) of 0.77229.

[Text Classification](https://github.com/mdjoh/Online-Orders-Text-Classification)

The objective of this project was to classify text from online orders using natural language processing (NLP). Shallow, hybrid, and deep methods were explored with deep methods using Transformers and the RoBERTa base language model yielding the best adjusted mutual information (AMI) score of 0.9381. Text preprocessing and other pre-trained language models were explored however, only tuning the number of epochs and batch size during training resulted in the highest AMI score.

[Inventory Optimization using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/mdjoh/RL-project)

We used reinforcement learning to optimize inventory control. Taking random actions led to losses approaching $8,000 which highlighted the need for a policy. While both algorithms converged at a profit, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm converged at a higher reward (approximately $8,000) than the advantage actor critic (A2C) algorithm.

[American Sign Language Recognition](https://github.com/mdjoh/ASL-ImageClassification)

Using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), American Sign Language (ASL) gestures were identified. Various neural network architectures were explored.
